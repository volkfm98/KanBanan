# KanBanan

This project served me as a polygon for learning, testing and trying new things such as Spring (IoC, Data, Security, Web MVC).
It is dirty and higly unscalable because it had no architecture design right from the beginning. That happened because I had no idea what this project should be (what it should do, what features it should has) and what Sping is.
